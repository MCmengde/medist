My implement of redis in rust

## Todo

### BASE PERIOD

- [] base client and server, support base commands (GET, SET...)
- [] support the five base value data type (string, list, hash, set and zset)
- [] abstract the file event and time event, optimize the server to be event-driven
- [] data persistence (RDB, AOF)
